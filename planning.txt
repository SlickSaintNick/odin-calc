Requirements:

- No eval()
- no newFunction() evaluating a string.

- functions for:
    - add
    - subtract
    - multiply
    - divide
- number1, operator, number2 variables.
- function operate(number1, operator, number2)
    - calls function for add / subtract etc.
- HTML calculator with:
    - 0-9, +-*/, =, clear
    - display
- functions (eventListeners) to populate display when clicking number buttons.
    - store 'display value' in a variable.
- function to evaluate and update display when clicking equals.

Extras to think about:
- Implement series of operators, e.g. 12 + 7 - 5 * 3 = 42
    - Erm... that is wrong? But yes that is also the way these simple calculators work.
- Round answers with long decimals to avoid overflow.
- Make sure '=' has error checking.
- Make sure 'clear' wipes out all data.
- If divide by 0, display an error message.

Expansions:
- Add decimals. Disable decimal button if the display has a decimal already.
- Add nice CSS.
- Add a backspace button.
- Add keyboard support.
